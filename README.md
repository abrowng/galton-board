# Galton Board Simulation
Repository for the Randomized Algorithms Assignment 1.

## Description

This project is a simulation of the Galton Board, a device used to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem. 
The Galton Board consists of a board with a triangular grid of pegs and a funnel at the top. 
Balls are dropped from the funnel and bounce off the pegs until they reach the bottom. 
The balls are collected in bins at the bottom of the board, and the distribution of balls in the bins approximates a normal distribution.

## Installation

To run the simulation, first you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine.
It is recommended to create a virtual environment to install the required packages.
You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Then, you can clone the repository and run the following command to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the simulation, you can use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
